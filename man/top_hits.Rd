\title{Provides the top results of a betaGLM object, sorted by adjusted p-value.}
\usage{
top_hits(object, coef = 2, method = "holm", alpha = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A `betaGLM` object.}

\item{coef}{The coefficient to report and use for p-value adjustment. Defaults to 2.}

\item{method}{The method for p-value adjustment. Available methods are a subset of those in `p.adjust`,
specifically those valid for dependent tests. Common choices include "holm", "hochberg", "hommel",
and "BH" (Benjamini-Hochberg)}

\item{alpha}{The significance level to use for filtering results. Defaults to 0.1.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the top hits, sorted by adjusted p-value.
}
\description{
This function performs multiple testing adjustment on the results of a betaGLM object
integrating taxonomic information. Various correction methods are available,
including Harmonic Mean P-value (HMP), Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg (BH).
